| Titanic Survival Analysis | Python (Pandas), Tableau | Exploratory data analysis on Titanic dataset | [View Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/TitanicI_TableauDashboardTableauPublic/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)


## 🔍 Key Findings
	•	🎩 Passenger Class:
First-class passengers had nearly 3x higher survival rates compared to third-class passengers.
	•	👶 Age Factor (Children):
	•	Second-class children → 100% survival
	•	First-class children → 80% survival
	•	Third-class children → 40% survival
	•	👵 Senior Passengers (65+):
	•	First-class seniors → 17% (only 1 survivor)
	•	Second & Third-class seniors → 0% survival

⸻

✅ Recommendations
	•	🚨 Improve emergency accessibility for lower classes to reduce survival inequality.
	•	🧒👵 Prioritize evacuation planning for children and senior passengers.
	•	📊 Conduct a follow-up statistical test (e.g., chi-square) to confirm whether survival gaps are statistically significant.
